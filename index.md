**Abstract**

<div style="text-align: justify"> Abstractâ€”Predicting the possible future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic agents is an essential requirement in autonomous driving. These trajectories mainly depend on the surrounding static environment, as well as the past movements of those dynamic agents. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of agent intentions makes the trajectory prediction problem more challenging. All of the existing models consider the target agent as well as the surrounding agents similarly, without considering the variation of physical properties. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module, that improves the accuracy of the predictions. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information. Furthermore, our model is able to run in real-time, achieving a high inference rate of over 300 FPS. </div>

## Internship Projects

Company: [Creative Software](https://www.creativesoftware.com/)
### Corrosion Detection using Semantic Segmentation

Corrosion Detection for industrial environment using semantic segmentation. I used U-Net model for semantic segmentation. I completed writing the model, testing and all the training. Using a combination of focal loss and dice loss increased the accuracy significantly and using lot of augmentations reduced false positives.

<center><img src="images/unet.png"/></center>

Synthetic data generation is also done using Unity 3D since the real image dataset was not enough.

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>
