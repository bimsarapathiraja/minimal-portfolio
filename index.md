**Title:** Multiclass Confidence and Localization Calibration for Object Detection

**Abstract**

<div style="text-align: justify"> Albeit achieving high predictive accuracy across many challenging computer vision problems, recent studies suggest that deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to make overconfident predictions, rendering them poorly calibrated. Most of the existing attempts for improving DNN calibration are limited to classification tasks and restricted to calibrating in-domain predictions. Surprisingly, very little to no attempts have been made in studying the calibration of object detection methods, which occupy a pivotal space in vision-based security-sensitive, and safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a new train-time technique for calibrating modern object detection methods. It is capable of jointly calibrating multiclass confidence and box localization by leveraging their predictive uncertainties. We perform extensive experiments on several in-domain and out-of-domain detection benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our proposed train-time calibration method consistently outperforms several baselines in reducing calibration error for both in-domain and out-of-domain predictions. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/bimsarapathiraja/MCCL. </div>

## <a id="self-driving-car-project"></a> [Self-Driving-Car-Stage-II] Multi-Sensor based Dynamic Object Detection, Tracking, and Trajectory Prediction

The final year project of the degree program and our project is based on dynamic object detection, tracking, trajectory prediction, signal light identification and data collection using LiDAR and camera. 

Worked on trajectory prediction and signal light identification for autonomous driving. We proposed Class-aware attention for trajectory prediction where the future trajectory of the target agent depends on the vehicle classes of both target and surrounding agents. The model ranked 12th position in the nuScenes trajectory prediction leaderboard and 1st place which uses rasterized maps for the implementation. Introduced a camera and LiDAR sensor fusion method that can be used for low-resolution LiDAR while still maintaining accuracy.

**Abstract**

<div style="text-align: justify"> Abstractâ€”Predicting the possible future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic agents is an essential requirement in autonomous driving. These trajectories mainly depend on the surrounding static environment, as well as the past movements of those dynamic agents. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of agent intentions makes the trajectory prediction problem more challenging. All of the existing models consider the target agent as well as the surrounding agents similarly, without considering the variation of physical properties. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module, that improves the accuracy of the predictions. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information. Furthermore, our model is able to run in real-time, achieving a high inference rate of over 300 FPS. </div>
